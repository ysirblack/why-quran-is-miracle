# Qur’an vs Torah vs Bible

This chapter compares three world‑shaping scriptures from the same monotheistic family: the Qur’an, the Torah (Tawrat), and the Bible (with focus on the New Testament/Gospel, Injil). The goal is clarity, not controversy. We note strengths, differences, and what matters for verifiability today.

## Scope and Aim

- Torah (Tawrat): The Five Books of Moses as received in the Jewish tradition; foundational narrative and law.
- Bible (Gospels/New Testament): The life and message of Jesus and apostolic writings preserved in Greek manuscripts alongside the Hebrew Bible.
- Qur’an: Arabic revelation recited by the Prophet Muhammad, preserved in a single liturgical language and corpus.

## Origin and Composition (High‑Level)

- Torah: Narrative + law; compiled and transmitted through a long scribal tradition. The Masoretic Text is the standard medieval Hebrew form; Dead Sea Scrolls reveal earlier variants; the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves a divergent tradition.
- Bible (NT): Four Gospels + Acts + Epistles + Revelation. Earliest complete codices date to the 4th century CE; earlier papyrus fragments exist. Canon formation involved church usage and councils; there are deuterocanonical differences across traditions.
- Qur’an: Revealed over ~23 years; compiled in the Prophet’s lifetime via memorization and writing, then standardized under the first successors to maintain a single reading across the expanding community. Qirāʾāt are canonical modes of recitation rooted in early transmission, within a stable consonantal skeleton.

## Language, Recitation, and Translation

- Torah: Liturgical Hebrew remains central; synagogue reading and cantillation preserve tradition. Translations (e.g., Septuagint) are ancient and diverse.
- Bible: Original languages (Hebrew/Aramaic for HB, Koine Greek for NT). Christianity grew as a translation‑driven movement; most communities read translations rather than Greek/Hebrew.
- Qur’an: One liturgical language; daily recitation worldwide. Memorization by millions acts as an error‑detecting network. Translations are considered explanations of meaning, not replacements for the Arabic text.

## Preservation and Manuscripts

- Torah: Masoretic precision (vowel points, accents, counting) aimed to protect text; DSS show both stability and variation in Second Temple period.
- Bible: Thousands of Greek manuscripts allow textual criticism to reconstruct earliest attainable text; also reveal variation (additions/omissions/word order).
- Qur’an: Early manuscripts and continuous oral transmission converge on a stable text. Canonical variants (qirāʾāt) are constrained and documented; the core remains the same across regions and centuries.

## Theology: God, Revelation, and Messenger

- All affirm one God. The Torah centers on covenant and law; the NT on Jesus as Messiah and salvation; the Qur’an on pure monotheism (tawḥīd), prophethood, and continuation/clarification of prior revelation.
- Qur’an self‑describes as a criterion (furqān) and a guard over earlier scripture (5:48), affirming Moses and Jesus while correcting at points of doctrinal dispute.

## Law and Ethics

- Torah: Detailed legal code (civil, ritual, moral) for Israel; justice, charity, and holiness are central.
- NT: Moral intensification (e.g., Sermon on the Mount), emphasis on inner transformation and grace; church law developed later in various traditions.
- Qur’an: Moral and legal guidance together—worship, contracts, family, penalties, war/peace rules, charity—paired with prophetic practice (Sunnah) as lived commentary.

## Women and Family (Selected Themes)

- Torah and NT honor women in many narratives but reflect historical social norms.
- Qur’an repeatedly addresses men and women in parallel in belief and reward (33:35), protects property rights (4:4, 4:32), condemns infanticide (81:8–9), mandates kindness and due process (4:19, 2:228–241), and criminalizes slander (24:4). The aim is protection and responsibility under law.

## War and Peace (Rules Matter)

- Torah includes narratives of ancient warfare in a specific historical setting.
- NT emphasizes non‑retaliation at personal level and love of enemies; state/war ethics elaborated later in Christian thought.
- Qur’an codifies constrained warfare: fight only those who fight you (2:190), incline to peace (8:61), honor treaties (9:4), grant asylum (9:6), uphold justice (5:8), forbid killing the innocent (17:33). Prophetic directives prohibit targeting non‑combatants.

## Media Myths vs Text

- “Oppression of women,” “war‑loving,” and “unlawful killing” accusations often ignore context and legal guardrails in the Qur’an. Core verses protect life and dignity, affirm justice even against one’s own side, and restrict use of force.
- Selective citation can distort any scripture. The remedy is context: read before/after, entire legal sections, and how the community historically operationalized the rules.

## Verifiability and Modern Scrutiny

- Torah and Bible can be studied via philology, history, archaeology, and textual criticism; their moral and theological claims are assessed through tradition and reason.
- The Qur’an adds something unusual: it is measurable in modern, empirical ways because a single standardized text enables global verification of structure. Examples (covered later with full rules):
  - Day‑form totals matching solar and lunar calendars (365, 354).
  - Name balances (Adam/Jesus 25:25) and semantic parity weaves (27/30/30/27).
  - Verse‑span encodings of physical constants (5778K Sun, 1538°C iron, 962°C silver).
  - Element signatures (iron 26/57) and astronomical alignments (Earth→Sirius 86 → 8.6 ly).

These are not proofs of God in a laboratory sense. They are converging signs that a text claims, and appears, to be intentionally composed in ways that withstand counting, checking, and statistical sanity checks.

## Difficult Passages Often Overlooked

It is fair to read any scripture in context and within its legal‑ethical tradition. It is also fair to acknowledge that all three contain passages modern readers find difficult. A few examples (read in full context before forming conclusions):

- Torah/Old Testament (selected):

  - Deuteronomy 20:16–18: command to leave alive “nothing that breathes” in certain Canaanite cities.
  - 1 Samuel 15:3: command regarding Amalek to strike “man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep…”.
  - Numbers 31:17–18: after battle with Midian, kill male children and non‑virgin women; young girls spared.
  - Deuteronomy 7:2: “show them no mercy” (herem context) toward specified nations.
  - Deuteronomy 21:18–21: the “rebellious son” stoning statute in Israel’s law code.
  - Leviticus 20:10: death penalty for adultery in the Mosaic legal framework.
  - Deuteronomy 22:20–21: stoning in cases of proven marital deception regarding virginity.
  - Deuteronomy 21:10–14: taking a captive woman as wife with specified procedures.
  - Numbers 5:11–31: “sotah” ordeal for suspected adultery (trial by bitter water).
  - Leviticus 12:1–5: postpartum purification periods; longer for a female child than a male.

- New Testament (selected):
  - Matthew 10:34: “I did not come to bring peace but a sword” (division as a consequence of discipleship).
  - Luke 19:27: parable ending, “bring those enemies… and slay them before me” (parable imagery of judgment).
  - 1 Timothy 2:12; 1 Corinthians 14:34: restrictions on women’s teaching/speaking in assembly (interpreted variously by traditions).
  - Revelation 19:15: messianic judgment imagery “strikes down the nations… rod of iron.”
  - Ephesians 5:22–24; Colossians 3:18; Titus 2:5: household codes emphasizing wives’ submission (balanced by commands to husbands to love sacrificially).
  - 1 Timothy 2:15: “saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith…” — widely debated in meaning and application.
  - 1 Peter 3:1–6: submission language alongside honoring women as co‑heirs (3:7).

Jewish and Christian scholars have contextualized these texts (historical commands, parables, symbolic apocalyptic language, or community‑specific norms). The point here is simple: it is inconsistent to single out the Qur’an as uniquely harsh while being unaware of the difficult passages in one’s own canon. Fair comparison requires fair reading on all sides.

## On the Trinity and Logical Simplicity

Classical trinitarian doctrine says: one God (one “being/essence”), three co‑equal, co‑eternal “persons” (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). It is not tritheism (three gods) nor modalism (one person with three masks); it is one “what,” three “whos.”

- Many find this metaphysically complex. In everyday logic, if Father ≠ Son ≠ Spirit and each is fully God, lay readers infer “three Gods,” which theologians deny by distinguishing essence from person. Passages are debated on both sides (e.g., John 1:1; 20:28 vs John 14:28; 17:3; Mark 13:32).
- The Qur’an teaches strict, unipersonal monotheism (tawḥīd): God is one without partners, not three in one. From a mathematical/logical simplicity standpoint, tawḥīd is the least complicated formulation of divine unity.

This section is not to score points but to clarify categories: if one’s own creed accepts mystery beyond ordinary identity logic, it is unbalanced to attack Islamic monotheism as simplistic; conversely, if one prefers conceptual economy, the Qur’an’s theology will feel coherent and direct.

## Why Accept Moses and Jesus, but Not Muhammad?

Many in the West revere Abraham and Moses as prophets, honor Jesus as Messiah, yet stop at Muhammad (peace be upon him). Fair questions deserve fair criteria. Here are reasons many conclude Muhammad is a true prophet in the same line:

- Continuity of core message: worship the one God, turn from idols, do justice, protect the weak, prepare for accountability — the same moral monotheism found in earlier prophets.
- Fruits of the mission: transformation of a society from tribal vendetta to rule of law; protection of orphans and women; prohibition of infanticide; institutionalized charity (zakat); literacy and law.
- Preservation and public challenge: a single living scripture preserved by mass memorization and manuscripts, accompanied by a standing challenge to produce its like — something empirically testable and historically unmatched.
- Measurable signs: internal structures that can be counted and verified (shown later) — unusual among scriptures and consistent with a claim to divine authorship in a measurable age.
- Prophetic criterion of integrity: biography marked by truthfulness, restraint, and consistency between message and life; enemies and followers alike attested to reliability (“al‑Amīn,” the trustworthy) prior to prophethood.

Common objections:

- “He came later, so the canon is closed.” But “closure” is a community decision; the question is evidential: has God spoken again? The answer should rest on the content, preservation, and signs, not on a date.
- “Not foretold in our canon.” Some see pointers (e.g., Deut 18:18; Isa 42; the Paraclete passages in John); others disagree. This book does not hinge on contested proof‑texts; it rests on the Qur’an’s own evidence.
- “Islam spread by the sword.” The text itself limits warfare (2:190; 8:61; 9:6) and centers guidance, law, and voluntary worship (2:256). Empire history is complex across all civilizations; judge the religion by its scripture and lived ideals.

If one accepts earlier prophets on the basis of message, fruits, and God’s signs, consistency suggests assessing Muhammad by the same standards. The chapters ahead present evidence fit for that assessment.

## Honest Limitations and Notes

- Textual history differs: Judaism and Christianity rely heavily on manuscript criticism; Islam relies on combined oral/written transmission. Each has scholarly tools and debates.
- Interpretation matters: law and ethics are applied through jurisprudence; isolated readings mislead. The Qur’an insists on justice and mercy while prescribing accountability; practice must be judged by the standards of the text, not vice versa.
- Canon and community: the NT canon emerged over time; the Torah’s form stabilized within rabbinic tradition; the Qur’an stabilized immediately post‑revelation with community‑wide recitation. These facts explain, in part, why the Qur’an invites measurement of internal structure.

## Bottom Line

All three books have shaped the conscience of civilizations. The Qur’an is distinctive today in three ways highly relevant to a modern reader: (1) preservation in one liturgical language with global memorization; (2) a public, standing challenge to match its discourse; and (3) countable patterns that can be tested independently. If a divine message should be both livable and examinable, the Qur’an uniquely offers both.
