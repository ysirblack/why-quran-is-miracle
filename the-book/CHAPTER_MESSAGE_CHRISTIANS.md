# A Message to Our Christian Friends

We write with respect and clarity. Many of us grew up admiring the Bible, loving Jesus, and trusting what we were taught. This book is not a polemic; it is an invitation to examine evidence and to compare claims with the same standard for everyone.

## Common Ground

- One God, Creator of all; moral law; love of neighbor; truthfulness; generosity; repentance; prayer.
- The Qur’an honors Jesus (Isa): born of the Virgin Mary, Messiah, a word from God and a spirit from Him; it calls Christians “People of the Book” and praises sincere monks and priests.

## A Fair Standard

Use the same rule for all scriptures: read in context, consider the whole legal‑ethical vision, and do not judge one text by its hardest lines while overlooking difficult passages in your own canon. We have listed representative hard texts from the Torah/Old Testament and the New Testament and addressed common myths about the Qur’an’s treatment of justice, war, women, and law.

## Jesus and the Qur’an

- Revered without divinization: the Qur’an presents Jesus as a mighty messenger and Messiah, miraculously born, performing signs by God’s permission.
- Adam and Jesus: the Qur’an notes a parallel—Adam created without father or mother; Jesus without a father—yet both remain human servants of God (cf. 3:59). Our evidence section also shows a surprising name balance (25:25) that mirrors this pairing.

## Questions Christians Often Ask

1. Why not the Trinity?

- Classical doctrine says one essence, three persons. Many lay readers experience this as a logical tension (1 ≠ 3). Islam teaches unqualified oneness (tawhid): God is a single, indivisible reality. If you prefer conceptual simplicity and direct worship of the Father alone, you will find Islam’s monotheism coherent and familiar.

2. Why not atonement through the cross?

- God’s mercy and justice do not require punishing an innocent. If God can create the universe, He can forgive directly those who repent and make amends. The Qur’an emphasizes personal responsibility and God’s readiness to forgive.

3. Why accept Muhammad as a prophet?

- Same message as earlier prophets (pure monotheism and justice), transformed a society’s ethics, preserved a single living scripture, and—uniquely—presents countable signs that withstand modern scrutiny. Apply the same evidential standard used to accept Moses and Jesus.

## A Measurable Claim

The Qur’an invites verification: a single, globally preserved text with structure you can count and test. We present multiple, independent alignments (calendars, balances, verse spans, element signatures) with clear rules and conservative probabilities. You do not have to trust us—follow the steps and see.

## An Invitation

If you love God, love Jesus, and love truth, we ask only this: read the Qur’an fairly, measure what can be measured, and judge by the same standard you use for your own texts. If a book from God exists today, it should be livable, morally serious, and open to examination. The Qur’an offers all three.

## Deeper Questions for Reflection

We offer these as honest questions, not to win points, but to seek clarity with you:

- Text and canon:
  - On what basis do you accept the present canon boundaries? If the early church discerned them, what prevents God from sending guidance again later?
  - With thousands of Greek NT manuscripts and known variants, what is your standard for “the earliest attainable text,” and how does this affect doctrine?
- Jesus and God:
  - Did Jesus explicitly say “I am God, worship me,” or did he direct worship to the Father (e.g., Mark 12:29; John 4:23; 17:3)?
  - How do you reconcile John 14:28 (“the Father is greater than I”) and Mark 13:32 (the Son does not know the hour) with co‑equal divinity?
- Trinity and worship:
  - If God is one, how do lay believers avoid practical tritheism when praying to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct persons?
  - If conceptual simplicity is a virtue, why prefer a three‑person essence over unqualified oneness (tawhid)?
- Atonement and justice:
  - How is it just for the innocent to bear the penalty of the guilty? If God is all‑powerful, why is blood necessary to forgive?
  - Do personal repentance, restitution, and transformation suffice for divine pardon in your theology?
- Law, grace, and morals:
  - If Jesus says he did not come to abolish the Law (Matt 5:17–19), how do later relaxations (e.g., dietary/Sabbath shifts) square with that?
  - Household codes: how should modern churches handle texts on women’s submission and silence (1 Tim 2:12; 1 Cor 14:34) while honoring Gal 3:28?
- Paul and Jesus:
  - Where Paul and the Gospels appear in tension (law vs. faith, works vs. grace), what is your harmonizing principle?
- Practice and images:
  - On praying through saints or Mary, what is the explicit biblical warrant? How does this align with the First Commandment and prophetic warnings against intermediaries?

If these questions open space for a simpler, more direct worship of the one God and a measured recognition of Muhammad as a messenger, we invite you to continue—read the evidence, test the claims, and decide with integrity.
