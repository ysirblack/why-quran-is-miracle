# Research Audit Guidelines

## Purpose

This document defines the standards and methodology for auditing the Quranic numerical patterns research to ensure:

- Statistical rigor and honesty
- Public scrutiny readiness
- Academic defensibility
- Factual accuracy without editorial bias

## Core Principles

### 1. Honest Probability Calculations

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate statistical models (hypergeometric for finite populations, permutation tests, etc.)
- Calculate expected values BEFORE comparing to observed values
- Report actual probabilities, not inflated estimates
- Show the methodology and test details

**Red Flags to Correct:**

- ❌ Claims like "1 in 1,000,000" without proper testing
- ❌ Using wrong statistical models (e.g., binomial when hypergeometric is correct)
- ❌ Cherry-picking patterns after seeing the data (Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy)
- ❌ Multiplying probabilities of dependent events
- ❌ No correction for multiple testing

### 2. Independence of Evidence

**Requirements:**

- Identify when patterns are arithmetically guaranteed
- Check if claims are restatements of already-analyzed patterns
- Verify that compound probabilities involve independent events
- Note dependencies explicitly

**Red Flags to Correct:**

- ❌ Counting the same pattern multiple times as independent evidence
- ❌ Claiming "57/57 split" as separate from parity analysis when it's the same thing
- ❌ Treating dependent constraints as independent miracles

### 3. Proper Statistical Testing

**Standard Methodology:**

1. **Load the data** - Use actual Quran text (quran-uthmani.txt)
2. **Observe the pattern** - Document what exists
3. **Calculate expected value** - What would random chance predict?
4. **Run permutation test** - Shuffle data, count how often pattern appears
5. **Report probability** - Exact matches / total trials
6. **State conclusion** - Present facts without editorial judgment

**Minimum Test Size:**

- At least 100,000 permutation trials for patterns
- Report exact match count, not just probability
- Include close matches (±tolerance) when relevant

### 4. Documentation Style

**DO:**

- ✅ State facts objectively
- ✅ Report probabilities clearly (e.g., "~1 in 833 (0.12%)")
- ✅ Show test details (e.g., "100,000 trials, 120 exact matches")
- ✅ Note arithmetic constraints
- ✅ Provide reproducible code

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Use judgmental language ("NOT a miracle", "not significant")
- ❌ Compare to previous incorrect claims
- ❌ Use phrases like "should not be claimed as..."
- ❌ Add editorial comments like "moderately significant" or "not extraordinary"
- ❌ Say "Honest Assessment" (implies previous was dishonest)

**Preferred Phrasing:**

- "Arithmetically guaranteed" (instead of "NOT a miracle")
- "Probability: X" (instead of "Moderately significant")
- "Statistical Assessment" (instead of "Honest Assessment")
- Just state the numbers, let readers judge

## Audit Checklist

For each pattern, verify:

### ☐ Pattern Verification

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Pattern exists as claimed (counts are correct)
- [ ] Data source is properly documented

### ☐ Statistical Analysis

- [ ] Appropriate statistical model used
- [ ] Expected values calculated before comparison
- [ ] Permutation test conducted (min 100,000 trials)
- [ ] Probability reported with test details
- [ ] Dependencies noted

### ☐ Independence Check

- [ ] Pattern is not a restatement of another pattern
- [ ] Arithmetic guarantees are identified
- [ ] Dependencies between claims are noted
- [ ] No double-counting of evidence

### ☐ Documentation Quality

- [ ] No judgmental editorial comments
- [ ] No comparisons to "incorrect" previous claims
- [ ] Facts presented objectively
- [ ] Code included for reproducibility
- [ ] Clear methodology described

### ☐ Files Updated

- [ ] README.md - Main explanation with corrected probabilities
- [ ] main.md - Technical details with statistical assessment
- [ ] EVIDENCE.md - Clear Q&A with honest probabilities
- [ ] honest_probability_analysis.py - Reproducible verification code

## Common Issues and Corrections

### Issue 1: Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy

**Problem:** Finding specific numbers (27, 30, 57) in data, then calculating probability of those exact numbers.

**Correction:**

- Acknowledge that patterns were observed in the data
- Use permutation testing to see how often such patterns occur
- Report actual empirical probability

### Issue 2: Arithmetic Guarantees Claimed as Miracles

**Problem:** Claiming patterns that MUST occur due to arithmetic constraints.

**Example:** "57:57 split in even-sum pattern"

- This equals odd-odd (27) + even-even (30) = 57
- It's guaranteed by parity properties
- Not independent evidence

**Correction:**

- State: "Arithmetically guaranteed"
- Note: Already analyzed in parity pattern
- Don't count as separate evidence

### Issue 3: Dependent Events Treated as Independent

**Problem:** Claiming multiple aspects as separate miracles when they're mathematically linked.

**Example:** Even-sum total = 6,236 AND odd-sum total = 6,555

- These MUST sum to 12,791
- Only one is independent

**Correction:**

- Note the dependency explicitly
- Only report probability for independent component

### Issue 4: Inflated Probability Claims

**Problem:** Claims like "< 1 in 1,000,000" without proper testing.

**Correction:**

- Run actual permutation tests
- Report empirical probability
- Example: 120 matches in 100,000 trials = ~1 in 833

## Combined Probability Analysis

After auditing all individual patterns, we tested them together using proper statistical methods.

**Original Combined Calculator Issues:**

- ❌ Bug: Used 149 surahs instead of 114
- ❌ Bug: Wrong six-block pattern matching logic
- ❌ Error: Tested guaranteed outcomes (57/57 splits)
- ❌ Error: Ignored pattern dependencies

**Honest Combined Analysis Results (1,000,000 trials):**

| Pattern             | Individual Probability | Combined Contribution |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Core 2×2 Grid       | ~1 in 6.7 (14.9%)      | Yes                   |
| Even-Sum Total      | ~1 in 907 (0.11%)      | Yes                   |
| Long/Short Swap     | ~1 in 7.9 (12.7%)      | Yes                   |
| Six-Block Symphony  | < 1 in 1,000,000       | Yes (bottleneck)      |
| Verse-Number Mirror | ~1 in 440 (0.23%)      | Yes                   |

**Combined Result:**

- **Observed**: < 1 in 1,000,000 (0 matches in 1M trials)
- **Theoretical** (if perfectly independent): ~1 in 595 billion
