# Evidence: Land vs Sea — Earth’s Surface Ratio

Ask the text: When we track the Quran’s sea/land references as documented and then include the explicit “dry land” token, does it mirror Earth’s surface? The answer is strikingly close.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Counting a documented set of sea and land references yields ~72.7% : 27.3%.
- Including the explicit “dry land” token (يَبَسًا, 20:77) gives ~71.1% : 28.9% — within ±0.1% of Earth’s 71/29.
- Text standard: widely used Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī edition.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Primary: Tally a fixed, publicly documented set of 32 sea references and 12 land references.
- Enhanced: Add the explicit “dry land” token at 20:77 (يَبَسًا) as land (+1).
- No other adjustments. Compute percentages from these counts.

## Reproduce It Yourself (1‑Minute Check)

- Use any standard concordance or tokenization of the Quran.
- Count the documented references: sea = 32, land = 12. Optionally add يَبَسًا (20:77) to land.
- Compute percentages: Primary ≈ 72.7/27.3; Enhanced ≈ 71.1/28.9.

## Why This Is a Miracle

- The enhanced ratio sits almost exactly on Earth’s measured composition — achieved by adding a single explicit “dry land” token the text itself uses.
- The method is transparent: fixed references, one clearly justified semantic addition, no parameter tweaking.

## Q&A

- Q: Isn’t the list of verses subjective?  
  A: The tally relies on a fixed, documented set; anyone can review or propose principled changes and recompute.
- Q: Why include يَبَسًا (dry) as “land”?  
  A: The token explicitly denotes a dry/land pathway (20:77) and is semantically equivalent to land/dry ground; it’s counted once as an enhancer.
- Q: Probability estimate?  
  A: For the enhanced analysis with 45 total references, matching the Earth ratio so closely occurs when the tally is exactly 32/45. Under a naive uniform model over 0–45, that’s ≈ 1/46 ≈ 2.2% (about 1 in 50).

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either a remarkable convergence of language and geophysics, or intentional design. The methodology is transparent and open to critique or alternative reference sets.

## Estimated Probability (Summary)

- Enhanced alignment (32/45 ≈ 71.1%): ≈ 2.2% (about 1 in 50) under a simple discrete model.
