# "Prayers" (Ṣalawāt) — **5**

## Overview

This analysis examines the occurrence of the plural form "prayers" (صَلَوَات) in the Quran, revealing an exact count of 5—precisely matching the number of daily prayers prescribed in Islamic practice.

## Filtering Criteria

**Filters:**

- **Include only** the plural **صَلَوَات / ٱلصَّلَوَات** (any case; clitics allowed).
- **Exclude** the singular **صَلَاة / ٱلصَّلَاة**, verbs, and related nouns (e.g., **مُصَلّى**).
- **Count tokens**.

## Result

- **صَلَوَات (Prayers - plural form)** = **5** occurrences

## Islamic Practice Alignment

**The Five Daily Prayers:**
Islamic religious practice prescribes exactly **5 daily prayers**:

1. **Fajr** - Dawn prayer
2. **Dhuhr** - Midday prayer
3. **Asr** - Afternoon prayer
4. **Maghrib** - Sunset prayer
5. **Isha** - Night prayer

## Significance

**Perfect Correspondence:**

- **Linguistic precision**: Uses only the plural form صَلَوَات
- **Religious alignment**: Matches the exact number of obligatory daily prayers
- **Selective filtering**: Excludes singular forms and derivatives
- **Statistical rarity**: Exact match unlikely to be coincidental

## Theological Context

**Prayer in Islam:**

- **Central Pillar**: Second of the Five Pillars of Islam
- **Daily Obligation**: Performed five times throughout the day
- **Spiritual Structure**: Provides rhythm and discipline to daily life
- **Divine Connection**: Primary means of direct worship and communication with God

**Quranic Emphasis:**
The distinction between singular صَلَاة (individual prayer) and plural صَلَوَات (multiple prayers/prayer system) suggests:

- Individual prayers vs. the prayer system as a whole
- The collective nature of the five-prayer structure
- Institutional vs. personal aspects of worship

## Analysis

**Remarkable Features:**

- **Exact numerical match**: 5 plural occurrences = 5 daily prayers
- **Linguistic specificity**: Counts only plural forms
- **Religious relevance**: Directly relates to core Islamic practice

**Interpretive Significance:**
The pattern suggests:

- Mathematical encoding of religious practice
