## Pattern

Two independent classifications of the same 66 surahs:

### By Difference Parity

| Difference (verses - position) | Count |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Odd                           | 34    |
| Even                          | 32    |

### By Position Parity

| Position | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Odd      | 32    |
| Even     | 34    |

## Symmetry

**34 / 32 / 32 / 34** (Mirror symmetry)

```text
Diff odd:   34  ←→  32  :Diff even
Pos odd:    32  ←→  34  :Pos even
```

The numbers mirror each other: 34-32 and 32-34
