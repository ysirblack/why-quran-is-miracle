# Golden Ratio Pattern

**Source:** Simetrik Kitap: Kur'an, pages 361-367

---

## Definition

For each surah, calculate: **position + verse count**

- **Mükerrer (Repeated):** This sum appears in more than one surah
- **Mükerrer olmayan (Unique):** This sum appears in exactly one surah

---

## The Pattern

| Category | Surah Count | Sum Total |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Repeated | 74 | 7906 |
| Unique | 40 | 4885 |
| **Total** | **114** | **12791** |

---

## Golden Ratio

**Ratio = 7906 / 4885 = 1.618424**

**Golden Ratio φ = 1.618034**

**Difference: 0.00039** (extremely close!)

---

## Additional Properties

- **7906 + 4885 = 12791** (which is PRIME!)
- 12791 = sum of all positions + sum of all verses
- The Quran's structure encodes the golden ratio!
