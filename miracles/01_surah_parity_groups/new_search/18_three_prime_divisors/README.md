## Definition

**Three Prime Divisors:** A number n has exactly 3 prime numbers in its divisor set.

**Note:** This book considers 1 as prime.

Examples:
- 6 has divisors {1, 2, 3, 6}, primes in set = {1, 2, 3} = 3 primes ✓
- 10 has divisors {1, 2, 5, 10}, primes in set = {1, 2, 5} = 3 primes ✓
- 30 has divisors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}, primes in set = {1, 2, 3, 5} = 4 primes ✗

## The Pattern

| Category | First Half (1-57) | Second Half (58-114) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Homogeneous | 25 | 25 |
| Heterogeneous | 32 | 32 |

---

## Symmetry

- **Homogeneous:** Equal split 25/25
- **Heterogeneous:** Equal split 32/32
- Both categories perfectly balanced between halves!
