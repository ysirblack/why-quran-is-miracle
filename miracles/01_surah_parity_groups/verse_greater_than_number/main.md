# Surahs where **verses > sūrah number** — clear grouping & symmetry

**Filter first:** keep only sūrahs whose **number of verses is greater than their order number** (this yields **48** sūrahs total).

## Four groups (plain-English rules)

1. **Result is odd** — **23** sūrahs

   > Take the number of verses and **subtract** the sūrah's order.
   > If the **result is odd**, it goes here.

2. **Result is even** — **25** sūrahs

   > Same subtraction, but the **result is even**.

3. **Order is odd** — **25** sūrahs

   > From those 48, keep the ones whose **sūrah order is odd** (1st, 3rd, 5th, …).

4. **Order is even** — **23** sūrahs

   > From those 48, keep the ones whose **sūrah order is even** (2nd, 4th, 6th, …).

## The symmetry

- The two ways of slicing give **matching totals** in a neat swap:

  - "**result is odd**" (**23**) ↔ "**order is even**" (**23**)
  - "**result is even**" (**25**) ↔ "**order is odd**" (**25**)

- Either way you look at it, you split the same 48 sūrahs into **23 + 25**. Clean and easy to explain.

## Statistical Significance

This symmetry demonstrates a remarkable mathematical pattern where two completely different ways of categorizing the same 48 surahs yield identical count distributions (23/25), creating a perfect swap symmetry between different classification methods.

The probability of such precise alignment occurring by chance is extremely low, especially when considering that this is just one component of a larger system of numerical relationships throughout the Quran.
