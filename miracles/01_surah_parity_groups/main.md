# Surah Parity Groups (Ḥafṣ/Tanzil)

## Overview

**Rule:** Basmalah counted **only** in Al-Fātiḥah. Group by _(āyāt parity – sūrah order parity)_.

## Summary

| Group         |  Count |
| ------------- | -----: |
| **odd–odd**   | **27** |
| **even–even** | **30** |
| **odd–even**  | **27** |
| **even–odd**  | **30** |

## Consequences / Notes

- Exactly **57** sūrahs have an **odd** number of verses: `odd–odd (27) + even–odd (30) = 57`.
- Exactly **57** sūrahs have an **even** number of verses: `even–even (30) + odd–even (27) = 57`.
- The two "mixed" groups mirror the two "same-parity" groups (27/30 vs 30/27) → a neat swap symmetry.
- This balance isn't forced by definition; it's a tidy pattern of the actual verse counts under this numbering.

**Label → Count Parity Alignment**

- If the group starts with odd, its count is 27 (odd); if it starts with even, its count is 30 (even):

- odd–odd → 27 (odd)
- odd–even → 27 (odd)
- even–even → 30 (even)
- even–odd → 30 (even)

**Is it a good symmetry?**
Yeah—it's clean: a **57/57 split** and **swapped 27/30** across parity. Whether it's _significant_ beyond aesthetics would need a statistical test; as a presentation nugget, it's solid and defensible.

## Sub-Analysis

This topic contains several detailed sub-analyses:

- [**Verses > Surah Number Analysis**](verse_greater_than_number/) - Analysis of surahs where verse count exceeds surah order number
- [**Even Sum Surahs**](even_sum_surahs/) - Surahs where (verse count + surah order) is even
- [**Long/Short Parity Analysis**](long_short_parity/) - 40-verse threshold parity patterns  
- [**Probability Analysis**](probability_analysis/) - Statistical calculations and significance testing
