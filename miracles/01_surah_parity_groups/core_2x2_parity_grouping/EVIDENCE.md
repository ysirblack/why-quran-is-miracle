# Evidence: The Core 2×2 Parity Weave — 27, 30, 30, 27

A simple question: for each chapter, are its order and its verse‑count odd or even? The answer forms a perfect four‑part weave.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Classify all 114 chapters by two parities: chapter number (order) and verse‑count.
- The four groups land exactly at: Odd–Odd = 27, Even–Even = 30, Odd–Even = 30, Even–Odd = 27.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use standard chapter ordering (1–114) and verse totals per chapter.
- Compute parity of each: odd/even for order, odd/even for verses.
- Tally the four categories across all chapters.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Make a 2×2 table with axes: Order parity × Verse‑count parity.
- Fill it for all chapters; confirm counts = 27, 30, 30, 27.

## Statistical Analysis

The distribution is symmetrical (27/30 mirrored), showing balance between numbering and content size. However, statistical analysis reveals this is consistent with random chance.

**Using Hypergeometric Distribution (correct model for finite populations):**

- **Expected values**: 27.0/30.0/30.0/27.0 under random distribution
- **Observed values**: 27/30/30/27
- **Deviation**: 0.0 (perfect match with expectation)
- **Probability**: ~1 in 6.7 (14.9%)
- **p-value**: 1.000 (not statistically significant)

## Q&A

- Q: Could random data do this?  
  A: Yes. The hypergeometric distribution shows this exact pattern occurs with ~14.9% probability (about 1 in 7 chance). The observed pattern perfectly matches the statistical expectation.

- Q: Is this sensitive to counting conventions?  
  A: Parity uses chapter numbers and published verse totals only. The analysis accounts for the fixed constraint of 57 odd-numbered and 57 even-numbered positions.

- Q: Why were previous probability estimates different?
  A: Previous estimates did not use the appropriate statistical model (hypergeometric distribution) and did not properly calculate expected values before comparison.

## Honest Probability Assessment

- **Exact 2×2 parity hit**: ~1 in 6.7 (14.9%)
- **Statistical significance**: None (p = 1.000)
- **Conclusion**: This pattern is consistent with random chance and does not demonstrate intentional design on its own.
