# Evidence: The Core 2×2 Parity Weave — 27, 30, 30, 27

A simple question: for each chapter, are its order and its verse‑count odd or even? The answer forms a perfect four‑part weave.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Classify all 114 chapters by two parities: chapter number (order) and verse‑count.
- The four groups land exactly at: Odd–Odd = 27, Even–Even = 30, Odd–Even = 30, Even–Odd = 27.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use standard chapter ordering (1–114) and verse totals per chapter.
- Compute parity of each: odd/even for order, odd/even for verses.
- Tally the four categories across all chapters.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Make a 2×2 table with axes: Order parity × Verse‑count parity.
- Fill it for all chapters; confirm counts = 27, 30, 30, 27.

## Why This Is a Miracle

- The distribution is symmetrical (27/30 mirrored), suggesting deliberate balance between numbering and content size.
- No tuning: every chapter is used exactly once; parities are intrinsic.

## Q&A

- Q: Could random data do this?  
  A: A rough binomial model (57 odd‑order, 57 even‑order) gives ≈ 1%–2% for these exact hits — already small before considering additional parity symmetries observed nearby.
- Q: Is this sensitive to counting conventions?  
  A: Parity uses chapter numbers and published verse totals only.

## Estimated Probability (Summary)

- Exact 2×2 parity hit: ≈ 1 in 100 (≈ 1%); compounded with adjacent symmetries, the chance diminishes further.
