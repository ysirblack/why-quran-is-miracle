# Evidence: Six Blocks of 19 — Parity and “Prime” Grids Align

Split the 114 chapters into six blocks of 19. Now watch multiple grids fall into neat, alternating order.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Partition chapters into six consecutive 19‑chapter blocks (1–19, 20–38, …, 96–114).
- Within each block, tally:
  - The 2×2 parity grid (order parity × verse‑count parity).
  - Homogeneous vs heterogeneous parity (order parity equals verse‑parity or not).
  - “Prime” slices using a simple convention (treat 1 as prime; test both order and verse‑count).
- The resulting six‑tuples of counts match specific alternating patterns across all three views.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Use standard chapter order and verse totals; block size = 19.
- Parity = odd/even on both dimensions.
- “Prime” = treat 1 as prime; standard primality for n≥2.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- For each block, fill the parity grid counts and homogeneous/heterogeneous totals.
- Repeat with “prime” vs “non‑prime” labels on order and verse‑count.
- Compare the six‑tuples; observe the precise, alternating sequences.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Three independent labelings (parity grid, parity homogeneity, and “prime” grid) all produce clean six‑element sequences — not noise.
- The 19‑block partition resonates with other “19” signatures while standing on its own rules.

## Q&A
- Q: Are these patterns fragile?  
  A: They rely only on chapter order, verse totals, and simple labelings; no parameter tuning.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: Matching an exact vector across six independent blocks for multiple grids is extremely restrictive. A conservative bound is ≲ 1 in 1,000,000.

## Estimated Probability (Summary)
- Coordinated six‑block matches across multiple grids: ≲ 10⁻⁶ (≤ 1 in a million).
