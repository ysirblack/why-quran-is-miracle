3. **ٱلنَّارِ (An-Nār)**: "The Fire" - Hell
4. **ٱلْجَحِيمِ (Al-Jaḥīm)**: "The Blazing Fire" - Another name for Hell

**Divine Justice Theme:**

- **Equal Representation**: Both destinies given equal textual weight
- **Balanced Presentation**: Neither outcome numerically favored
- **Fair Warning**: Equal emphasis on both consequences
- **Ultimate Choice**: Human actions determine final destination

## Quranic Context

**Typical Usage Patterns:**

**Paradise References:**

- **2:82**: "But those who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally."
