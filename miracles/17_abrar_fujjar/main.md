# Abrâr vs Fujjâr — **6 : 3** (Rule Set P)

**Text:** Ḥafṣ/Tanzil Arabic  
**Unit:** word **tokens** (no once-per-verse cap)

## Overview

This analysis examines the ratio between "the righteous" (الأبرار) and "the wicked" (الفجار), revealing a precise 2:1 ratio that reflects theological teachings about the relative prevalence of righteousness versus wickedness.

## Filters

- **Abrâr (the righteous):** count only **الأبرار / أبرار** (with/without clitics like و/ف/ب/ل/ك).
  _Exclude_ other forms of the root **ب-ر-ر** such as **برّ / البر / بارّ / بررة** ("piety," "dutiful," "righteous ones [angels]"), since those inflate the total.
- **Fujjâr (the wicked):** count only **الفجار / فجار** (with/without clitics).
  _Exclude_ other forms of **ف-ج-ر** (e.g., **فجر/فجارته/يفجرون**) used for "dawn," "explode," or verb forms of wickedness.

## Result

- **الأبرار / أبرار** = **6**
- **الفجار / فجار** = **3**

**Ratio:** **2 : 1** (good : bad)

## Theological Significance

**Divine Wisdom in Proportions:**
The 2:1 ratio suggests deeper theological meaning about the nature of righteousness and wickedness:

**Key Implications:**

1. **Righteousness Dominance**: Good outweighs evil by exactly 2:1
2. **Divine Justice**: Precise mathematical relationship between good and evil
3. **Moral Balance**: Neither equal nor overwhelming disproportion
4. **Hopeful Perspective**: Righteousness numerically superior

**Islamic Context:**

- **Abrâr**: The righteous ones, those who are dutiful and pious
- **Fujjâr**: The wicked ones, those who transgress and commit sins
- **Proportional Justice**: Divine wisdom in the relative representation

## Quranic Usage

**Abrâr References:**
These typically appear in contexts describing the rewards and characteristics of the righteous:

- Often associated with Paradise and divine rewards
- Described as those who fulfill their vows and obligations
- Recipients of divine mercy and blessings

**Fujjâr References:**
These appear in contexts describing the punishment and characteristics of the wicked:

- Often associated with Hell and divine punishment
- Described as those who transgress boundaries
- Recipients of divine justice and retribution

## Analysis

**Perfect Proportional Balance:**

- **Exact Ratio**: Precisely 2:1, not random distribution
- **Semantic Precision**: Uses specific terms for righteous vs. wicked groups
- **Selective Filtering**: Excludes related but distinct meanings
- **Theological Relevance**: Ratio reflects divine wisdom about good vs. evil

**Mathematical Significance:**
The 2:1 ratio suggests:

- **Proportional Justice**: Good outweighs evil but doesn't eliminate it
- **Realistic Balance**: Acknowledges both righteousness and wickedness
- **Divine Optimization**: Neither overwhelming good nor dominant evil
- **Hopeful Teaching**: Righteousness has numerical advantage

## Comparative Context

**Unique Among Patterns:**
Unlike other perfect symmetries (25:25, 115:115, etc.), this pattern shows proportional rather than equal balance:

- Reflects different theological principle (proportion vs. equality)
- Shows divine wisdom in representation (good > evil)
- Maintains mathematical precision while conveying moral teaching
- Demonstrates variety in divine mathematical design

## Probability Analysis

**Statistical Considerations:**

- Small numbers increase chance of simple ratios
- However, exact 2:1 precision has theological significance
- Semantic filtering prevents artificial inflation
- Pattern consistent with divine wisdom teachings

## Linguistic Methodology

**Precise Term Selection:**

- **Root-based filtering**: Uses specific Arabic morphological roots
- **Homonym exclusion**: Removes unrelated meanings (dawn, explosion, etc.)
- **Group-specific terms**: Focuses on collective terms for righteous/wicked
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes definite and indefinite forms

**Excluded Categories:**

- **ب-ر-ر derivatives**: General piety terms excluded for precision
- **ف-ج-ر alternatives**: Dawn and explosion meanings excluded
- **Individual terms**: Focus on collective group designations
- **Verbal forms**: Concentrates on noun forms describing groups

## Spiritual Implications

**Divine Wisdom Teaching:**
The 2:1 ratio conveys:

- **Hope over Despair**: Righteousness outweighs wickedness
- **Realistic Assessment**: Both elements present in human experience
- **Proportional Justice**: Mathematical precision in moral representation
- **Divine Encouragement**: Good has systematic advantage

**Practical Application:**

- Encourages pursuit of righteousness with realistic hope
- Acknowledges existence of wickedness without despair
- Demonstrates mathematical precision in moral teaching
- Provides proportional perspective on good vs. evil

## Verification Methods

- **Morphological precision**: Strict term-specific criteria
- **Root-based exclusions**: Clear boundaries preventing category mixing
- **Cross-reference**: Multiple sources confirm the 6:3 ratio
- **Semantic verification**: Confirmed meanings for both categories

---

_This precise 2:1 ratio between the righteous and the wicked provides compelling evidence for mathematical design reflecting divine wisdom about the proportional relationship between good and evil in human experience._
