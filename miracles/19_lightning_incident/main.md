## Qur'an **13:13** (Ar-Raʿd - The Thunder)

**Arabic (13:13):**
`وَيُسَبِّحُ الرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَاعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَهُمْ يُجَادِلُونَ فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ`

**Translation:**
_"The thunder proclaims His praise—as do the angels out of awe of Him. He sends the thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills, yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might."_

**Key Elements:**

- **Thunder** (الرَّعْدُ) praising God
- **Thunderbolts** (الصَّوَاعِقَ) being sent
- **Striking** (فَيُصِيبُ) whom He wills
