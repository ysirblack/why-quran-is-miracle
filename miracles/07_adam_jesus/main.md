# Adam & Jesus — Proper-Name Tokens (Tanzil Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī)

## Rule / Filter

- Count **proper-name tokens** only: **آدم** (Ādam) and **عيسى** (ʿĪsā).
- Count **every token** (no per-verse cap).
- Clitics allowed; treat orthographic variants as the same name.
- **Exclude** titles/epithets (**المسيح**, **ابن مريم**), pronouns, and non-name words.

## Result

- **Ādam (آدم)** = **25 tokens** (QAC dictionary explicitly states 25)
- **ʿĪsā (عيسى)** = **25 tokens** (QAC concept page: "Verse List … 25 occurrences")

## Why it's surprising

- **Explicit equivalence in the text:** **3:59** says, _"The example of Jesus with Allah is like that of Adam…"_—a direct pairing by the Qur'an itself.
- **Mirrored mode of origin:** both are portrayed **without a human father**—Adam from clay (e.g., **38:71–72**), Jesus by a virgin birth (**19:20–21**).
- **Global count symmetry:** across the whole corpus and after excluding titles (e.g., _al-Masīḥ_), their **proper-name totals tie exactly 25:25**, matching the theological pairing.

## Theological Significance

**Quranic Parallelism:**
The Quran explicitly draws a parallel between Adam and Jesus in 3:59:

> "Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was."

**Shared Characteristics:**

1. **Unique Creation**: Both created without human fathers
2. **Divine Command**: Both brought into existence by divine "Be" (كن)
3. **Miraculous Origin**: Adam from clay/dust, Jesus through virgin birth
4. **Prophetic Status**: Both hold special positions in Islamic theology

## Probability Analysis

Let prophet-name totals plausibly range up to the high end (Moses ≈ **136** mentions).

- **Tie at any value:** $P \approx 1/(136+1) = \mathbf{0.73\%}$. (Two distinct names end up equal.)
- **Exact tie at 25:25:** $P \approx 1/137^2 = \mathbf{0.0053\%}$ (≈ 1 in 18,800)

## Analysis

**Remarkable Features:**

- **Perfect numerical balance**: Exact 25:25 count ratio
- **Theological coherence**: Matches explicit Quranic pairing in verse 3:59
- **Filtered precision**: Uses only proper names, excluding titles and epithets
- **Statistical rarity**: ~0.73% for any tie, ~0.005% for this specific count

**Interpretive Significance:**
The numerical balance reinforces the theological message that these two figures represent parallel examples of divine creative power—both brought into existence through unique, miraculous means that transcend normal human reproduction.
