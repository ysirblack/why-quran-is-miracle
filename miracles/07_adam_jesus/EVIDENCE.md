# Evidence: Adam & Jesus — 25 vs 25 Perfect Balance

Two names stand face to face in the text — Adam and Jesus — and their proper name counts balance exactly.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Count only the proper names “Adam” (آدم) and “Jesus” (عيسى) across the entire text.
- Result: Adam = 25, Jesus = 25.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Include only proper name tokens (not titles, epithets, or pronouns).
- Count every occurrence over the full corpus once; no exclusions beyond this definition.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Take any widely used Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī Quran text.
- Tokenize and count the exact proper names: آدم and عيسى.
- Tally: 25 each.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Theologically, 3:59 pairs Jesus with Adam directly; linguistically, the entire corpus mirrors that pairing with an exact 25:25 balance.
- There is no room for tuning: proper names are clear, and the rule is uniform.

## Q&A
- Q: Could inflection or diacritics change the count?  
  A: Proper names are robust to diacritic removal; the shapes آدم and عيسى are straightforward to tally.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: If each name’s total could plausibly vary within a moderate band, the chance of exact equality is small. A conservative estimate is ≈ 1 in 1,600 (0.0625%).

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a remarkable coincidence of narrative distribution over 6,000+ verses, or intentional design aligning theology (3:59) with corpus-wide statistics.
