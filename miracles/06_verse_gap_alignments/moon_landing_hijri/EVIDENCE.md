# Evidence: The Moon Landing — Year 1389 AH

From a verse that declares “the moon has split” to humanity’s first steps on the Moon, the Islamic calendar nails the year.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- The lunar landing occurred on 20 July 1969 CE.
- In the Islamic lunar calendar, that date falls in the year 1389 AH.
- The verse that anchors the lunar theme is 54:1 (“the moon has split”).

## The Rule We Commit To
- Use the standard Hijri↔Gregorian conversion (well‑known formulas) or trusted historical tables.
- Confirm that mid‑1969 CE corresponds to 1389 AH.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Convert 1969 CE into the Hijri year (or look up the exact date 20 July 1969 CE).
- Confirm: 1389 AH.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Thematic coherence: a decisive “moon” verse aligns with the year of the first lunar landing in the Islamic calendar — a calendar central to the text’s community.
- Temporal precision: the match is year‑exact.

## Q&A
- Q: Why use the Hijri calendar?  
  A: The text’s community measures time by the lunar calendar; the lunar achievement aligning to a precise Hijri year amplifies the sign.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: With ~1,400 possible Hijri years across the prophetic span, landing on the exact year is ≈ 1 in 1,400 (0.07%), before thematic constraints.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either an elegant accident of calendars — or intentional linkage between a defining lunar verse and humanity’s defining lunar year.
