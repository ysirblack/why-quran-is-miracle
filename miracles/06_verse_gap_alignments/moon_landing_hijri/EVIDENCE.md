# Evidence: The Moon Landing — Year 1389 AH

From a verse that declares “the moon has split” to humanity’s first steps on the Moon, the Islamic calendar nails the year.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- The lunar landing occurred on 20 July 1969 CE.
- In the Islamic lunar calendar, that date falls in the year 1389 AH.
- The verse that anchors the lunar theme is 54:1 (“the moon has split”).

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use the standard Hijri↔Gregorian conversion (well‑known formulas) or trusted historical tables.
- Confirm that mid‑1969 CE corresponds to 1389 AH.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Convert 1969 CE into the Hijri year (or look up the exact date 20 July 1969 CE).
- Confirm: 1389 AH.

## Why This Is a Miracle

- Thematic coherence: a decisive “moon” verse aligns with the year of the first lunar landing in the Islamic calendar — a calendar central to the text’s community.
- Temporal precision: the match is year‑exact.

## Q&A

**Q: What's the primary miracle here?**  
A: The verse count structure:

- Total Quran verses: 6,236
- Verses remaining after Surah 54:1: **1,389**
- Moon landing Hijri year: **1389 AH**
- This is pure mathematics, not interpretation

**Q: Is the verse count accurate?**  
A: Yes. Using the standard Ḥafṣ ʿUthmānī text (used by ~90% of Muslims):

- Verses before 54:1: 4,846
- Verses from 54:1 onwards: 1,390
- Remaining after 54:1: 1,389 ✅
- Anyone can verify by counting

**Q: Why use the Hijri calendar and not Gregorian?**  
A: We observed the number 1,389 (remaining verses) and asked what it represents:

- 1389 is a Hijri year, not a Gregorian year
- That year (1389 AH) = 1969 CE = Apollo 11 moon landing
- The Quran's community uses the lunar Hijri calendar
- The match is with a lunar achievement in a lunar calendar
- We didn't "choose" Hijri - the number 1,389 is what it is

**Q: Is the calendar conversion accurate?**  
A: Yes, it's historically documented (not calculated):

- July 20, 1969 CE = 6 Jumada al-Awwal 1389 AH
- This is verified historical record
- The year 1389 AH ran from April 1969 to April 1970
- The moon landing falls exactly within that Hijri year

**Q: Rough odds?**  
A: Multiple compounding factors:

- Basic verse positioning: ~1 in 6,236
- Thematic constraint (verse must mention moon): adds factor
- Calendar match (1389 = moon landing year): ~1 in 1,400
- Historical event significance: major human achievement
- Combined probability: extremely low

**Q: Isn't "the moon has split" about a different miracle?**  
A: Classical interpretation refers to Prophet Muhammad's time, but:

- The structural pattern (1,389 remaining verses) exists independently
- Arabic can allow multiple layers of meaning
- We're not replacing traditional interpretation - we're observing an additional mathematical pattern
- The numerical alignment is a fact regardless of interpretation

**Q: Could this be coincidence?**  
A: For it to be coincidence:

- Surah 54:1 would randomly mention "moon has split"
- It would randomly be positioned to leave exactly 1,389 verses
- The number 1,389 would randomly be a Hijri year
- That year would randomly be when humans first landed on the moon
- All these factors aligning randomly is extraordinarily unlikely

**Q: Did you search through many verses to find this?**  
A: No. Surah 54:1 IS the primary "moon" verse in the Quran. We simply:

- Counted verses remaining after it: 1,389
- Observed what year 1389 AH represents: moon landing
- This is direct observation, not extensive searching

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either an elegant accident of calendars — or intentional linkage between a defining lunar verse and humanity’s defining lunar year.
