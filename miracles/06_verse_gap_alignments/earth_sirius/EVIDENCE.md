# Evidence: Earth → Sirius — 86 Words = 8.6 ly

In “The Star” chapter, the count from “the Earth” to “Sirius” encodes Sirius’s distance.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Count words from 53:32 after the token “the Earth” (ٱلْأَرْضِ) to 53:49 including the token “Sirius” (ٱلشِّعْرَىٰ).
- Total = 86 words → 8.6 light‑years (Sirius’s distance).

## The Rule We Commit To

- Fixed within Surah 53 (An‑Najm): start after the specific Earth token in 53:32, end including the Sirius token in 53:49.
- Count words as space‑separated tokens; treat the two anchor tokens exactly as defined.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Take a standard Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī text of Surah 53.
- Identify ٱلْأَرْضِ in 53:32 and ٱلشِّعْرَىٰ in 53:49.
- Count words from after the Earth token to and including Sirius.
- Total: 86.

## Why This Is a Miracle

- Thematic purity: The chapter is literally “The Star.” The path runs from Earth to the brightest night star named explicitly.
- Numerical precision: 86 → 8.6 light‑years.
- Historical point: Stellar distances were unknown until modern parallax/spectroscopy.

## Q&A

- Q: Why these specific tokens?  
  A: They’re the explicit mentions of “the Earth” and “Sirius” in that chapter.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: Within a plausible 60–120‑word span, landing exactly on 86 is roughly 1 in 61 (≈ 1.6%).

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either a poetic coincidence landing exactly on the modern measurement — or deliberate design encoded in the word pathway.
