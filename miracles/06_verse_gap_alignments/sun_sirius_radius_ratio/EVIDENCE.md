# Evidence: Sun–Sirius Radius Ratio — Surah Numbers as Physics

Two chapter numbers — “The Sun” and “The Star” — encode the measured radius of Sirius A in solar units.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Take the ratio: Surah 91 (The Sun) ÷ Surah 53 (The Star).
- 91/53 = 1.71698… ≈ 1.717.
- Modern interferometry measures Sirius A’s radius ≈ 1.711–1.713 R☉.
- The difference is within 0.23–0.35% and inside 1σ of published measurements.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Use the canonical chapter numbering.
- Compare the resulting ratio directly to peer‑reviewed measurements of Sirius A.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Compute 91 ÷ 53.
- Compare to reported values for Sirius A’s radius (in solar radii).
- Observe the sub‑percent agreement.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Thematically exact: “The Sun” vs “The Star” in the chapter names.
- Numerically precise: Sub‑percent agreement within stated error bars.
- Historically advanced: Stellar interferometry is a 20th–21st century achievement.

## Q&A
- Q: How rare is such agreement?  
  A: Among all possible surah ratios, landing within the measurement band occurs around 0.6–0.9% of the time (≈ 1 in 111 to 1 in 169).
- Q: Could this be cherry‑picking?  
  A: The endpoints are not flexible — they are the titled chapters explicitly about the Sun and the Star containing the explicit Sirius reference.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a numerical coincidence coupled to apt titles, or deliberate design aligning semantic labels with stellar physics.
