# Evidence: Baltic Sea Coordinates — 55°N, 19–20°E

Two verses describe two seas meeting with a barrier. Their chapter and verse numbers encode the very coordinates where such halocline barriers are observed.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Chapter 55, verses 19–20 describe “two seas” with a “barrier between them”.
- The Gulf of Gdańsk lies near 55°N, 19–20°E — a known mixing zone with density barriers (haloclines).
- Encoding: 55 (chapter) → 55°N; 19–20 (verses) → 19–20°E.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Use standard chapter and verse numbering.
- Compare those numbers directly to real‑world coordinates of a documented sea‑barrier location.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Look up the location: Gulf of Gdańsk (Baltic Sea).
- Confirm its approximate coordinates: 55°N, 19–20°E.
- Compare to 55:19–20; observe the numeric match and topical relevance.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Exact degree‑level match in both latitude and longitude, paired with verses explicitly about a sea‑barrier phenomenon that modern oceanography confirms.

## Q&A
- Q: Could this be cherry‑picking a location that happens to fit?  
  A: The Baltic’s halocline barriers are textbook; the Gulf of Gdańsk is a natural, prominent example that squarely fits both the numbers and the description.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: Treating coordinates coarsely by integer degrees, there are ~64,800 (180×360) combinations. Hitting the exact pair by chapter:verse encoding is roughly 1 in 64,800 before thematic filters.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a remarkable numeric‑geographic coincidence with perfect topical fit — or purposeful coordinate encoding pointing to a real, scientifically verified phenomenon.
