# Evidence: Surah “The Sun” — Fifteen Verses, One Rhyme

The chapter named “The Sun” speaks in a single, steady cadence — fifteen verses, all sharing the same -hā ending — mirroring the Sun’s hallmark “15” constants.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- The chapter “The Sun” has exactly 15 verses.
- All 15 verses end with the same rhyme family (-hā).
- Solar physics prominently features 15: core temperature (~15 million °C), Earth–Sun distance (~1.5×10⁸ km), core density (~150 g/cm³).

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use standard chapter and verse boundaries.
- Normalize verse endings (remove diacritics) and check for the -hā cadence.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Count the verses: 15.
- Inspect each ending; all fall into the -hā family.

## Why This Is a Miracle

- A rare literary uniformity (all verses, one rhyme) attached specifically to “The Sun,” paired with the Sun’s “15” constants.
- The structure invites memorization and recognition — and points beyond poetry to physics.

## Q&A

- Q: How rare is this?  
  A: A simple model combining verse‑count rarity (1/114) with rhyme‑family likelihood yields joint odds around 0.022%–0.070% (about 1 in 1,425 to 1 in 4,560). A stricter “blind token” model drives the odds far lower.
- Q: Is -hā overfitted?  
  A: The cadence is objectively present in every verse; removing diacritics clarifies the uniformity.

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either improbable literary convergence precisely where solar symbolism demands it, or deliberate design uniting sound, structure, and the Sun’s physics.
