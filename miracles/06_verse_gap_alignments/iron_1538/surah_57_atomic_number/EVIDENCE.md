# Evidence: Iron — 26 and 57, By Name and Number

Iron sits at the crossroads of language, number, and physics — exactly where you would expect if the composition were intentional.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Abjad (gematria) value of “iron” (حديد) = 26 — iron’s atomic number.
- Abjad value of “the iron” (الحديد) = 57 — the mass number of stable isotope Fe‑57.
- The chapter titled “Iron” is number 57.
- The key iron verse appears at verse 25; when counting the opening (Basmalah) in the local enumeration, the position registers 26 — the atomic number.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use the standard Abjad values for Arabic letters (historically established before Islam).
- Sum the letters of حديد and الحديد; compare to 26 and 57.
- Read the “Iron” chapter’s number (57) and the iron verse’s position.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Compute Abjad(حديد) and Abjad(الحديد); confirm 26 and 57.
- Open the “Iron” chapter: its number is 57; its iron verse is at 25 (or 26 with Basmalah counted locally).

## Why This Is a Miracle

- Multiple independent alignments — lexical arithmetic, chapter numbering, and verse position — all lock onto iron’s atomic identity.
- Each alignment is clear‑cut and uses long‑established systems (Abjad, chapter numbering).

## Q&A

- Q: Isn’t Abjad arbitrary?  
  A: The letter‑number mapping predates Islam and has a fixed traditional assignment; the sums are mechanical.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: Hitting the chapter number (57) alone is 1/114 ≈ 0.88%. Combining with an exact verse‑position alignment (~1/30) and two exact Abjad sums drives the chance to well below 1 in 3,000, even before considering the semantic lock.

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either a cluster of numerical coincidences around a single element — or deliberate encoding of iron’s atomic identity into the chapter that bears its name.
