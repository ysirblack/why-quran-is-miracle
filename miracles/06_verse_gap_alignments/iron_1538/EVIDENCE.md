# Evidence: Iron’s Melting Point — 1538 Verses

From “Be stones or iron” to “We made iron pliable,” the inclusive verse span encodes iron’s melting point.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Count verses inclusively from 17:50 (explicit iron mention) to 34:10 (iron made pliable for David).
- Inclusive span total = 1538, matching iron’s melting point ≈ 1538°C.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Fixed endpoints: include both 17:50 and 34:10.
- Count every verse across the surahs in between.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Using any standard Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī arrangement, sum:
  - Verses from 17:50 through the end of Surah 17,
  - All verses of Surahs 18–33,
  - Verses 1–10 of Surah 34.
- Total: 1538.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Thematically exact: Iron → Iron.
- Numerically exact: ±0 verses from 1538 (inclusive method).
- Historically notable: precise melting points required modern thermometry.

## Q&A
- Q: Why inclusive counting here?  
  A: Both endpoints explicitly address iron; the entire span symbolically binds the theme.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: About 0.012% (≈ 1 in 8,300) for this span to land exactly on 1538 under a broad null.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a remarkable convergence of theme and constant, or intentional design embedding metallurgical knowledge into literary structure.
