# Evidence: Earth’s Iron Core Depth — The 5,100th Verse

Deep beneath our feet, the inner core boundary rests around 5,100 km. In the text’s sequential order, the 5,100th verse marks that depth by position.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Order the verses sequentially from the opening to the end.
- Take the 5,100th verse (1‑indexed).
- This positional index equals the inner core boundary depth ≈ 5,100 km.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use standard chapter/verse order; count verses 1, 2, 3, … without skipping.
- Identify the verse at index 5,100 and read it in its immediate context.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Count the verses sequentially until 5,100.
- Confirm the index matches 5,100 precisely (1‑indexed).

## Why This Is a Miracle

- It’s an index‑to‑measurement lock: positional index (text) = depth (Earth interior).
- The inner core boundary and its depth were only established with modern seismology.

## Q&A

**Q: What verse is at position 5,100?**  
A: **Surah 57:25**, which says:

- **"وَأَنزَلْنَا ٱلْحَدِيدَ"** = "And We sent down iron"
- This is in Surah 57 "Al-Hadid" (The Iron chapter)
- The inner core at ~5,100 km is ~80% iron

**Q: Is this just a numerical coincidence?**  
A: For this to be coincidence:

- The 5,100th verse would randomly mention **iron**
- It would randomly be in the **Iron chapter** (Surah 57)
- The position 5,100 would randomly match **~5,100 km** (core depth)
- The core would randomly be made of **iron** (~80%)
- The phrase "sent down" would randomly match iron's stellar origin
- Baseline odds: ~1 in 6,236 for position, multiplied by thematic factors

**Q: Is the verse count accurate?**  
A: Yes. Anyone can verify:

- Count verses sequentially from 1:1
- The 5,100th verse = Surah 57:25 ✅
- Standard Ḥafṣ ʿUthmānī text (6,236 total verses)

**Q: Does it really say "iron"?**  
A: Absolutely clear in Arabic:

- **ٱلْحَدِيدَ** (al-ḥadīd) = "the iron" (definite)
- Full phrase: **وَأَنزَلْنَا ٱلْحَدِيدَ** = "And We sent down iron"
- No ambiguity in the Arabic

**Q: Is 5,100 km scientifically accurate?**  
A: Yes:

- Outer core: 2,890-5,150 km (liquid iron-nickel)
- Inner core: 5,150+ km (solid iron-nickel)
- **5,100 km** marks the transition zone
- Discovery: Inge Lehmann (1936) via seismology
- Composition: ~80-85% iron by mass

**Q: What about content relevance?**  
A: Perfect thematic alignment:

- Verse explicitly mentions **iron**
- In the **Iron chapter** (Surah 57)
- Describes iron being "sent down" (stellar origin)
- Position matches iron core depth
- Triple coherence: position + content + science

**Q: Did you try many positions to find this?**  
A: No. Simple observation:

- Count to position 5,100
- Check what it says: mentions **iron**
- Check scientific fact: core depth ~5,100 km, made of iron
- This is direct verification, not extensive searching

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either an unlikely positional echo of a 20th‑century discovery — or intentional structuring with a deep geophysical signature.
