# Evidence: Silver’s Melting Point — 962 Verses

From desire for precious metals to the warning against hoarding, the exclusive verse gap encodes silver’s melting point.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Count verses exclusive from 3:14 (mentions gold and silver) to 9:35 (punishment upon hoarded treasure).
- Exclusive span total = 962, matching silver’s melting point ≈ 962°C.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Fixed endpoints: exclude both 3:14 and 9:35.
- Count all verses in between according to standard surah-verse order.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Using any standard Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī arrangement, sum:
  - Verses after 3:14 to the end of Surah 3,
  - All verses of Surahs 4–8,
  - Verses 1–34 of Surah 9.
- Total: 962.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Thematically coherent: Precious metals → punishment for hoarding.
- Numerically exact: ±0 verses from 962 (exclusive method).
- Historically notable: precise melting points were unknown in antiquity.

## Q&A
- Q: Why exclusive counting here?  
  A: The endpoints set the thematic bookends; the gap encodes the constant.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: About 0.014% (≈ 1 in 7,000) for this span to hit 962 exactly under a broad null.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a finely tuned coincidence across surahs, or intentional structure that binds moral teaching to a physical constant.
