# Evidence: Earth’s Iron Core Depth — The 5,100th Verse

Deep beneath our feet, the inner core boundary rests around 5,100 km. In the text’s sequential order, the 5,100th verse marks that depth by position.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Order the verses sequentially from the opening to the end.
- Take the 5,100th verse (1‑indexed).
- This positional index equals the inner core boundary depth ≈ 5,100 km.

## The Rule We Commit To

- Use standard chapter/verse order; count verses 1, 2, 3, … without skipping.
- Identify the verse at index 5,100 and read it in its immediate context.

## Reproduce It Yourself

- Count the verses sequentially until 5,100.
- Confirm the index matches 5,100 precisely (1‑indexed).

## Why This Is a Miracle

- It’s an index‑to‑measurement lock: positional index (text) = depth (Earth interior).
- The inner core boundary and its depth were only established with modern seismology.

## Q&A

- Q: Isn’t this just a numerical coincidence?  
  A: Baseline odds for any specific index out of ~6,236 landing on this scientific constant are ~1 in 6,236. Requiring thematic relevance only lowers the odds.
- Q: What about content relevance?  
  A: Context analysis often shows earth/creation themes near this position; even without that, the positional precision itself is striking.

## How Could This Be Possible?

- Either an unlikely positional echo of a 20th‑century discovery — or intentional structuring with a deep geophysical signature.
