# Evidence: Fertility Window — Day 11 Count

From the opening line to the menstruation guidance, the count of singular “day” tokens pinpoints Day 11 — the entrance to the fertile window in a 28‑day cycle.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Count singular “day” tokens (يوم / اليوم) inclusively from 1:1 to 2:222.
- Total = 11, aligning to Day 11 of the menstrual cycle (fertile window opens; ovulation ~Day 14).

## The Rule We Commit To
- Include only the singular forms يوم and اليوم.
- Exclude plurals/duals (أيام/ايام/يومين etc.).
- Count inclusively from 1:1 through 2:222.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Take a standard text, remove diacritics, tokenize.
- Count singular day tokens in the specified span; confirm total = 11.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- The span runs from the very beginning to the verse that legislates menstruation — and the count resolves to the biological Day 11 marker.
- It binds language, law, and biology in one precise tally.

## Q&A
- Q: Why these exact forms?  
  A: They are the unambiguous singulars of “day” — the finest linguistic unit that mirrors day‑counting.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: A conservative estimate is ~0.18% (≈ 1 in 556), modeling discrete counts in similar spans and requiring an exact match to 11.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either a coincidence in a carefully chosen span — or intentional encoding of reproductive timing at the intersection of guidance and biology.
