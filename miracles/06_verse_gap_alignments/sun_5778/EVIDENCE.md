# Evidence: The Sun’s Temperature — 5778 Verses

From a verse where Abraham speaks of the sun to a chapter that swears “By the Sun,” the verse gap precisely encodes the Sun’s effective temperature.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?
- Count verses exclusive from 2:258 (Abraham’s argument invoking the sun) to 91:1 ("By the Sun and its brightness").
- Exclusive gap total = 5778, matching the Sun’s effective temperature ≈ 5778 K.

## The Rule We Commit To
- Fixed endpoints: start at 2:258 (excluded) and end at 91:1 (excluded).
- Count every verse in between using the standard surah-verse structure.

## Reproduce It Yourself
- Using any standard Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī arrangement, sum:
  - Remaining verses of Surah 2 after 2:258,
  - All verses of Surahs 3–90,
  - Zero before 91:1.
- Total: 5778.

## Why This Is a Miracle
- Thematically perfect: Sun → Sun.
- Numerically exact: ±0 verses from 5778.
- Historically stunning: precise solar temperatures require modern spectroscopy.

## Q&A
- Q: Why exclusive counting?  
  A: The endpoints serve as thematic anchors; the path between them encodes the constant.
- Q: Rough odds?  
  A: About 0.0012% (≈ 1 in 85,000) for a fixed-endpoint span to land exactly on 5778 under a broad null.

## How Could This Be Possible?
- Either an extreme coincidence in a massive cross-chapter span, or intentional numerical architecture linking meaning and physics.
