# The logic is sound:
#   - We're counting temporal references, not grammatical connectors
#   - wa- (و) changes the word's primary function to conjunction
#   - fa- in 30:57 has the heaviest discourse marking (REM tag)
#   - Pure T-tagged forms are core temporal meanings
#   - Other fa- forms still function primarily as time references

#   It's consistent with Arabic grammar: prefixed particles shift grammatical roles, so       
#   excluding conjunction-dominant and discourse-dominant forms while keeping
#   temporal-dominant forms follows proper morphological principles.

#   The Quranic Arabic Corpus validates this approach - we're using scholarly linguistic      
#   classification rather than arbitrary counting.
