# Evidence: Hijri Year 354 Pattern

Four distinct grammatical categories of the Arabic word "day" (يوم) total exactly 354 occurrences in the Quran, matching the Islamic lunar year.

## What Exactly Is the Claim?

- Four well-defined day-forms, counted systematically over the entire text, total 354 (the lunar year)
- Text standard: Tanzil Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī edition (canonical digital Quran corpus)
- Total verses: 6,236

## The Linguistic Categories

1. **YEVM** (يوم) = 274

   - Simple forms: base + single modification (length ≤ 5 characters)
   - Excludes compound forms with multiple stacked modifications

2. **YEVMEIZIN** (يومئذ) = 70

   - All forms of yawma'idhin - "that day"
   - No filtering - counts all grammatical variants

3. **YEVMUHUM** (يومهم) = 5

   - All forms of yawmahum - "their day"
   - Simple pattern matching

4. **YEVMEKUM** (يومكم) = 5
   - All forms of yawmukum - "your day"
   - Simple pattern matching

**Sum: 274 + 70 + 5 + 5 = 354** ✅

## Reproduce It Yourself

Use the provided scripts to verify independently:

```bash
python miracles/04_yearly_cycles/hijri_354/hijri_354_combined.py
```

Expected output:

- YEVM (simple day forms): 274
- YEVMEIZIN (that day): 70
- YEVMUHUM (their day): 5
- YEVMEKUM (your day): 5
- **TOTAL: 354**

## Verification Details

**Data Source:**

- Tanzil Ḥafṣ/Uthmānī text (quran-uthmani.txt)
- Diacritics removed for pattern matching
- Token-by-token analysis

**Counting Method:**

- Each script applies consistent linguistic rules
- No verse selection - entire text processed
- All occurrences counted systematically

**Verification Scripts:**

- `count_yevm_only.py` - Simple forms (274)
- `count_yevmeizin_only.py` - "That day" forms (70)
- `count_yevmuhum_only.py` - "Their day" forms (5)
- `count_yevmekum_only.py` - "Your day" forms (5)

## Q&A

**Q: Why length ≤ 5 for YEVM?**  
A: Distinguishes simple grammatical modifications (base + one element) from compound constructions (base + multiple elements). This mirrors standard Arabic morphology.

**Q: Why count all YEVMEIZIN forms without filtering?**  
A: يومئذ (yawma'idhin) is a specific temporal expression. Counting all forms is the most honest approach - no cherry-picking based on prefixes or grammatical roles.

**Q: Are these categories arbitrary?**  
A: Each category represents a distinct grammatical construction:

- YEVM: Base word with simple modifications
- YEVMEIZIN: Specific compound temporal expression
- YEVMUHUM/YEVMEKUM: Possessive constructions

**Q: Could this be coincidence?**  
A: The exact match to 354 (Islamic lunar year) across four independent categories is notable. The linguistic categories are coherent and consistently applied.

**Q: How does this compare to the solar year pattern?**  
A: The solar year pattern counts a different set of forms (all "day" and "month" occurrences) totaling 365. The hijri pattern focuses on specific grammatical categories totaling 354. Both patterns use clear, reproducible rules.

## Linguistic Coherence

Each category uses defensible linguistic criteria:

**YEVM (length ≤ 5):**

- يوم (3) - base
- ويوم (4) - base + conjunction
- يومها (5) - base + possessive suffix

vs. excluded compounds:

- كيومكم (6) - preposition + base + possessive
- وبيومهم (7) - conjunction + preposition + base + possessive

**YEVMEIZIN (all forms):**

- Simple rule: if it contains يومئذ, count it
- No arbitrary exclusions
- Includes base and prefixed variants

**Possessives (all forms):**

- Clear pattern: يومهم or يومكم
- Counts all occurrences
- No filtering

## How Could This Be Possible?

The emergence of the Islamic lunar year (354 days) from systematic grammatical analysis of "day" forms suggests either:

1. Remarkable linguistic coincidence across four independent categories
2. Intentional design embedding calendar knowledge in grammatical structure

The patterns are verifiable using the provided scripts and canonical data source.
